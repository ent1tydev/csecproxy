# CSECProxy ☁️
A proxy server for Windows supported by the free CSEC community to bypass internet blockages and prevent censorship.

**Launches the built-in Windows 10 proxy server with CSEC Free settings and proxies your traffic through a secure HTTPS connection on CSEC servers.** 
Fixed a connection problem (with the inscription "Connected!" the connection does not occur). Moving from cmd to vbs for 100% connection and other minor bugs

**The application is fully finalized.**
